ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SreeBhavanaSM 

ðŸŒ± I'm a frontend web developer with 2 years of experience in UI/UX design, creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. I've worked on ASP.NET projects and am currently enhancing my skills with React to build modern, responsive web applications.


ðŸ‘€ Outside of coding, I'm passionate about sketching, gaming, and watching movies â€” all of which inspire my creative approach to design and development.
